        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Maryam Ahmed and I am an incoming 3rd year
            student at The University of Illinois at Chicago studying Computer Science. I lived in Toronto
            for five years and spent one year in India before moving to the USA when I was six. <br />
            My hobbies include reading, playing badminton, and baking. I would say that my most favorite literary
            series are <i>The Inheritance Cycle<i> by Christopher Paolini, <i>Ranger's Apprentice<i> by John Flanagan, 
            and <i>The Infernal Devices<i> by Cassandra Clare. As for baking, I am a fan of creating cake recipes.<br />
